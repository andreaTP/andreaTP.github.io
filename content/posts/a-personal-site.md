:megaphone: I finally decided to create my personal website! :megaphone:

I'm not new to writing blog posts and other kind of content and here you have a couple of examples:

- [Lightbend 2021: `Writing Kubectl plugins with Scala or Java, with Fabric8 Kubernetes client on GraalVM`](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/writing-kubectl-plugins-with-scala-or-java-with-fabric8-kubernetes-client-on-graalvm)
- [Codacy 2020: `Top 6 items for your code review checklist`](https://blog.codacy.com/top-6-items-code-review-checklist/)

But I have been lazy enough to always rely on someone else website :smile:

Here we go, now I have an amazing domain name and a pretty solid starting point with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
